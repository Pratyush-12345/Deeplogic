# AI Document Understanding Pipeline

This project aims to build an AI-powered document understanding pipeline using advanced NLP techniques, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The pipeline is capable of processing various document formats, extracting essential information, and enabling user interaction through a chatbot interface.

## Features

- **Document Conversion, OCR, and Preprocessing**: Convert PDF documents into a standardized format suitable for LLM processing. Integrate OCR to extract text from images within documents and perform preprocessing steps for optimal LLM performance.

- **LLM-Powered Understanding and Actions**: Integrate a Large Language Model into the pipeline to enable advanced document understanding. Extract essential information, classify documents into predefined categories, and perform internal translation.

- **User Interaction via a Chatbot Interface**: Create a user-friendly chatbot interface that allows users to upload documents, ask questions about the document's content, request specific information extraction, and review extracted data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- See `requirements.txt` for Python library dependencies
